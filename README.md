# war_or_peace_py

> The simple card game war!

## Learning Goals:
> This was my first python project. It taught me a lot about python's data types, how to instantiate classes, and how much I took Ruby's enumerables for granted! I also learned how to use the `breakpoint()` command to jump into the code and peek at variables and how the methods are changing them. 


## Future Goals:
- Account for a MAD or War turn with player has less cards required
